st.markdown("""
Vivino's origins trace back to Mr. Geppetto, an old Italian man with a remarkable talent for wine tasting and business acumen.
Originally from Italy, Mr. Geppetto's family owned a vineyard for centuries. In 2035, he moved to Belgium, where he decided to harness his expertise in wine to establish a company. 
His vision and passion for wine led to the creation of Vivino, a company that blends innovation with tradition to offer exceptional wine experiences.

st.markdown("""Vivino is now under the control of four individuals who fervently profess their commitment to revitalizing the wine market, promising a fusion of innovation and tradition that will redefine the industry. They declare their mission to restore the wine market to its former glory, but beneath the veneer of their noble rhetoric lies a stark truth. Their grand promises of unparalleled experiences are overshadowed by a more insidious reality: a relentless pursuit of money and fame. While they project an image of passion and dedication, their true drive is a quest for personal gain and public acclaim. The facade of their purported vision masks the cold reality of their ambitions.""")
